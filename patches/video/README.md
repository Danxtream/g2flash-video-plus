# Cached decoder ownership

The internal worker API is inert until a caller explicitly starts it. No boot
path creates a video allocation, task or timer. Start requires a live framebuffer
lease and an absent texture cache. Release jim's previous lease normally before
acquiring the video lease; this owner never frees another client's resources.

Call start, stop and reset outside the image mutex and display gate. Handlers
already holding the image mutex may only request cancellation there, then leave
that scope before reaping. The future presenter keeps image-before-display lock
order and pins borrowed output with the generation token. No decoder call, heap
operation, task termination or worker wait occurs while those locks are held.

Heap 20 owns the decoder's actual size/alignment, all requested tables/planes and
scratch, the allocation ledger, static task control block and 16 KiB stack.
Requests determine sizes, including untagged STL growth; tags are diagnostic.
The owner byte cap is 206,904 bytes, excluding the future four 4 KiB input slots.
Retain 32 KiB in cached heap 20, 32 KiB in display heap 13 and 16 KiB in heap 27.
Live free/max views do not reserve memory: each allocation and its resulting
reserve is checked. Heap 13 admission includes the missing 153,600-byte shadow
and caller-supplied outstanding ingress/inflater peak. Existing buffers are not
charged twice. There is no video allocation or fallback in heaps 13 or 27.

Only the worker constructs and destroys C++. Its complete runtime table is
published before arming and remains bound through cancellation and destruction.
A normal stop drains output/callback pins, destroys the fully initialized
decoder and parks. Fatal callbacks never unwind or free partial objects: they
cancel and park. The controller terminates the parked, different task before
clearing the provider and reclaiming the raw ledger, stack and owner. Failed
termination, timeout, stack guard failure or an unknown RTOS ABI quarantines
ownership and refuses another start. Deferred completion tokens live in the
stable context, so publication-lock contention cannot lose private cleanup.

platform.h uses the authenticated Even 2.2.9.22 CMSIS services. The donor's
osThreadNew accepts a 112-byte caller-owned TCB and supplied stack; its static
flag is 2 at byte 109. osThreadTerminate synchronously reclaims a different task;
prvDeleteTCB preserves both supplied buffers with that flag. Check the flag after
creation and never terminate the current worker from itself. Priority 8 and
bounded sleeps leave services, interrupts and the watchdog running normally.
The firmware's exact-base hash guard also authenticates these service bytes.

After termination, video_worker_get_report exposes requested object bytes,
cached storage peak, heap free/max snapshots, both stack guards and downward
stack high-water from the 0xa5 sentinel. Heap snapshots precede final raw reclaim;
storage_left becomes zero only after reclaim completes. Invalid diagnostics in
quarantine are never sampled from a running task. These fields persist until a
new start. Native tests validate sentinel accounting using a simulated stack;
actual ARM high-water requires a later explicit hardware worker run.

The firmware build emits .su files for the C unit, runtime and decoder modules
alongside its objects. Call-graph estimates must include indirect runtime/heap
callbacks, bounded library recursion, backend helpers and stock RTOS/allocator
stack. The static estimate complements guards and runtime high-water; it does
not replace them. Callback tracing remains compiled with an empty callback:
this C API provides no trace setter.
